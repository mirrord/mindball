# mindball
a game of mental fortitude for the Raspberry Pi

1. get the raspberry pi and install raspian

1-b. pick up two NeuroSky Mindwave headsets (https://www.amazon.com/NeuroSky-80013-001-MindWave-Headset/dp/B00A2UQUXY)

2. install:
python_games (http://www.pygame.org/news.html)
python_mindwave (https://github.com/akloster/python-mindwave/archive/master.zip)
RPiGPIO (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO)

3. grab my code

4. put my code in /home/pi

You can now run mindball.py and mindball2p.py from the command line as self-contained games.
Optionally, continue for experimental stuff.

5. follow this site to hook up a 5v stepper motor:

6. disable the X server by editing .xsession

7. mount a magnet on the motor, the motor on rails, and eclose everything in a box

8. put an iron ball bearing on top

9. write the rest of the code to run the game using the motor, and maybe some hall effect sensors to determine endgame scenarios

Congratulations! You have completed MINDBALL, the game of bluetooth telekinesis!
